I have several enhancements in mind for future releases. Some of them is:

  

-  **Difficulty Levels **  Introduce multiple difficulty levels, such as easy, medium, and hard, by varying the grid size. For example, an easy level could have a 3x3 grid, while a hard level could have a larger 5x5 grid, making the game more challenging.

-  **Hints and Tips ** Include a hint system that provides players with clues or tips on how to solve the puzzle when they get stuck. This feature can help novice players without revealing the entire solution.

-  **Save Game Progress **  Enable players to save their progress in the middle of a game so that they can continue from where they left off in a subsequent session.

-  **Multiplayer Mode **  Implement a multiplayer mode that allows players to compete against each other in real-time, either by solving the same puzzle simultaneously or by racing to complete it first.

These are just a few things that I would like to add to my game,your wishes and suggestions for new features are welcome and appreciated.

  actions taken based on the feedback from JSHint:

![JS Validator](assets/images/screenshots/jsValidator.JPG)<br>

  

### Metrics Provided by JSHint

- There are **19 functions** in this code.

- The function with the largest signature takes **2 arguments**, while the median number of arguments is **0**.

- The largest function has **24 statements** in it, which indicates a moderate level of complexity and potential areas to refactor for maintainability.

- The most complex function has a value of 3, while the median across the codebase is 1. This suggests a particular function could benefit from simplification to improve readability and ease of maintenance.

  

### Warnings and Fixes:

JSHint has highlighted the use of ES6 syntax and features. 
I have configured JSHint to recognize ES6 by setting 'esversion: 6'.
 This allows to use modern JavaScript features like const, let,
  and template literals, which enhance the code's readability and efficiency.
