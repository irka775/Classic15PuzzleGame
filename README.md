-  **Hints and Tips** Include a hint system that provides players with clues or tips on how to solve the puzzle when they get stuck. This feature can help novice players without revealing the entire solution.

-  **Save Game Progress**  Enable players to save their progress in the middle of a game so that they can continue from where they left off in a subsequent session.

-  **Multiplayer Mode:**  Implement a multiplayer mode that allows players to compete against each other in real-time, either by solving the same puzzle simultaneously or by racing to complete it first.

These are just a few things that I would like to add to my game,your wishes and suggestions for new features are welcome and appreciated.
